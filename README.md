# Comprehensive Multicollinearity Analysis

This GitHub repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide and collection of resources related to multicollinearity, a critical concept in statistics and data analysis. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more predictor variables in a regression model are highly correlated, leading to issues in model interpretation, stability, and inference. This repository covers a wide range of topics related to multicollinearity, including its causes, consequences, detection methods, and strategies for mitigation.
